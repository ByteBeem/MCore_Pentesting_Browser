## Features

- **Browser Core**: A fully functional custom-built browser for web interactions.
- **Pentesting Tools**: Integrated pentesting capabilities for network and web application testing.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI for ease of use.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between the GUI, browser logic, and pentesting tools.
- **Custom Logging**: Detailed logging and reporting of pentesting results.

## Expanded Features:

- **Pentesting Tools Integration:

Automated Vulnerability Scanning: While browsing, the browser silently runs automated vulnerability scans in the background. It checks for common issues like:
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Open ports and weak services
Outdated CMS or web frameworks

- **Exploit Testing: The browser can automatically attempt exploits on discovered vulnerabilities, such as running SQL queries or sending crafted XSS payloads to test how the target reacts.
Malware Detection: The software can flag potentially harmful content such as malware injections, malicious redirects, or suspicious JavaScript.

- **Background Vulnerability Scanner:

Passive and Active Scanning:
Passive mode: Simply monitors traffic and checks for vulnerabilities without sending additional probes or requests.
Active mode: Actively sends exploit payloads and probes the website while you browse.

- **Real-Time Vulnerability Alerts: Alerts are shown in the UI whenever a vulnerability is found, with a severity rating (low, medium, high, critical) based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).
